# RL_algorithms
In this folder, I will add different examples of basic RL algorithms (Q-learning, DQN, Actor-Critic, multi-agent, etc)


## 1- Q_learning-FrozenLake-v1
This is the code from [HuggingFace Deep Learning course](https://huggingface.co/learn/deep-rl-course/unit2/hands-on?fw=pt), to learn Q-learning with the FrozenLake-v1 gym environment.
